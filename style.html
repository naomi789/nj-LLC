            <h2>Style guide</h2>
            <p>For couple's portrait sessions</p>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The clothes you choose to wear can really make or break your portrait session! Most importantly, pick clothes that you feel comfortable and confident in. Here are some tips on how to pick clothes that will make you look good, too!
        </P>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Choose a color scheme</b></li>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-2 col-12-small">
              <a class="image fit"><img src="images/weddings/SNJ_0453.jpg" alt="wedding party"></a>
            </div>
            <div class="col-10 col-12-small">
              <p>I recommend choosing one color (red, blue, green, etc) and then pairing them with neutrals (khaki brown, denim, white, grey, etc).
                Try searching online for "engagement wardrobe color palette 2021" if you need some ideas to get you going.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <li><b>Wear solid colored clothing</b></li>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-2 col-12-small">
              <a class="image fit"><img src="images/engagements/SNJ_0227.jpg" alt="couple between tree branches"></a>
            </div>
            <div class="col-10 col-12-small">
              <p>Subtle prints, like pinstripe suit coats or subtle polka dots are nice, but anything busier can be distracting.
                Try experiementing with textures instead (sweaters, lace, denim, etc)! Definetly avoid clothing with words, logos, or characters,
                unless you're bringing spiritwear to your graduation photoshoot.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- <li>Sleeves</b></li>
            <p>I recommend tops with sleeves because your arms can draw attention away from your face.</p> -->

          <li><b>Shoes</b></li>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-2 col-12-small">
              <a class="image fit"><img src="images/weddings/rosie_steve/NJ3_7432.jpg" alt="closeup of shoes"></a>
            </div>
            <div class="col-10 col-12-small">
              <p>Wear something you're comfortable in: avoid new shoes that might give you blisters because you'll likely be doing a bit of walking between backgrounds!
                Make sure the shoes match the setting: if your portrait session is at the beach, stilettos might look out of place.
                Gentlemen, your socks should match your pants, your shoes should match your belt, and I highly recommend polishing your shoes.
              </p>
            </div>

          <li><b>Bring accessories!</b></li>

            </div>
            <div class="col-10 col-12-small">
              <p>Bring a hat, vest, scarf, sweater, or some jewllery! These are easy to take on and off, and will give your photos more variety.

            </div>
            <div class="col-10 col-12-small">
              <p>I recommend taking your glasses or sunglasses off 15-20 minutes before your session so their is time for the marks on your nose have time to disappear.
                If you plan on wearing them, I'll work with you to minimize reflection and glare!</p>

            <div class="col-10 col-12-small">
              <p>If you're going to get your haircut, do it at least two weeks before your session so you're more used to it!
                Think about your outfit before you pick a hairstyle:
                if you're wearing an evening gown, try a fancy up-do. But if you're wearing a tshirt and jeans, a pony tail would be perfect.
                If it's windy or you are prone to fly-away hair, bobby pins or hair ties might be helpful to bring in case you decide to put your hair up.
                Make sure that your nails look well-trimmed and clean. If you're going to paint them, make sure the color doesn't clash with your outfits,
                and remember that if you're wearing sandals we can see what color your toe nails are too!

            </div>
            <div class="col-10 col-12-small">

              <p>If you're doing <u>maternity photos</u>, I recommend bringing one or two ultrasounds. Trim the edges (and decide if you want to cut off your name and birthdate from the image).
                You can also consider bringing one or two pieces of baby clothes (a pair of shoes, a white onesie, a dress) or a toy (stuffed bear, wooden train) or wooden blocks that spell out "girl", "boy", or your baby's name.

              <p>
                For <u>family photos</u>, I recommend bringing a blanket for everyone to sit on for some of the pictures.
                I recommend bringing a toy or snack for your smaller kids--- if a meltdown starts approaching, we can get some couple pictures of mom and dad while your kids take a short break, plus I can capture some pictures of them with their
                favorite
                toy!
                For babies, I recommend bringing a toy that I can hold up above my camera to rattle, squeek, or shake to try and get their attention.

              <p>
                For <u>graduates</u>, don't forget your cap, gown, tassel, any cords or stoles that you earned, and your class ring! I recommend ironing your gown before the shoot ;)
                Everything else is optional. Some people want to pop the bubbly in their session, blow confetti at the camera, bring a pet, balloons, or textbooks.
                Feel free to bring props related to what you studied or the clubs you were in: we can take photos in your cheerleading outfit, basketball jersey, or with the instrument you played in marching band!
                If you're in medical school, consider wearing scrubs for one of your outfits, or bring a stethescope to wear around your neck.
