            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>

          </div>
        </header>
        <h3>Background info</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>What should I know about your pricing?</li>
          <p>My most popular package is a 40 minute couple's session for $199.
            I shoot at many locations that have no extra charge, but ask for a
            quote because I occasionally charge for parking, tolls, ferries, or
            for driving time. I'm currently photographing proposals for free in
            the Seattle area!
          </p>
          <li>What is your typical process for working with a new customer?
          </li>
          <p>
            I'll give you a quote once we chat about location, date/time, and
            what you're looking for (proposal, engagement, bridal, wedding, or
            maternity). I offer a free consultation for all my wedding couples
            on the phone to make sure we're a good match, and I'm happy to chat
            more if you think of other questions. Once you send the contract and
            non-refundable retainer over, I will save your date for you. I have
            a list of style tips and location ideas if you need inspiration!
          </p>
          <p>
            After your photoshoot, delivery time depends on how long your
            session was, and time of year (August is my busiest month).
          </p>
          <li>What types of customers have you worked with?
          </li>
          <p>I've worked with all kinds of couples! Folks of different genders,
            sexualities, races, religions... People who want to showcase their
            career in their photos, and humans who want to show off their
            fur-baby or favorite neighborhood.
          </p>
          <li>Describe a recent project you are fond of. How long did it take?
          </li>
          <p>The price tag of a 40 minute session looks steep, but you're
            actually paying for over two hours of work! I often spend 30 minutes
            getting ready by researching the location, chatting with the client
            about outfits, talking about preferred poses/props, and answering
            other questions. Driving time to&from can add up, especially for
            destination weddings. Afterwards I often spend a full hour culling
            the photos and editing them than I spent time taking them!
          </p>
          <li>How many weddings have you shot?</li>
          <p>Ten weddings and three bridal sessions across six different states
            (as of April 2021).
          </p>
          <li>What gear do I use?</li>
          <p>I shoot with Nikon DSLRs. My primary camera is a full-frame D750
            and my backup is a crop sensor D5600. I'm comfortable with OCF,
            so be sure to let me know if your venue prohibits flash.
            I have two Pentax film cameras, and am happy to add film to your wedding
            package for an additional cost.
          </p>
          <li>What are "bridal portraits"?</li>
          <p>If you're not familiar with the southern tradition of bridals---
            it's a portrait session usually 4-6 weeks before the wedding (or
            sometimes after the wedding)! Historically, it was just the bride,
            but more and more couples are opting to have it be a "first look"
            so the couples can see each other in their wedding attire for the first time.
            Bridal sessions give you the flexibility to go to more distant locations,
            the opportunity to schedule the session for golden hour, and it gives
            me (the photographer) plenty of time to edit and print the photos if
            you want to display any at your wedding reception!
          </p>
          <!-- <li>What happens if I am sick?</li>
          <p>I have never missed a wedding yet, but if I did I know several
            local wedding photographers that I have collaborated with before who
            would be able to cover for me.</p> -->
          <li>Have I ever shot at your venue?</li>
          <p>Probably not! Actually, 100% of the weddings I have shot have
            been new locations for me. Because I scope out venues online
            and arrive early to walk around, I feel very comfortable shooting at
            new locations. </p>
          <li>Will I use a shot list? </li>
          <p>Yes and no! I always ask couples to help me plan family portraits:
            do you want pictures of you & your parents, you & your parents & your partner,
            you & your partners parents, you & your partners parents & your partner...
            Or would one picture with your partner and both sets of parents be sufficient?
            I ask about this ahead of time so you can have your parents or another
            relative check to see if any combinations were forgotten (maybe an uncle
            you don't know well really wants a picture) or let me know about any
            dynamics I should be aware of (divorces, deaths, terminal illness, etc).
            I also pose the bridal party for the group portraits,
            you & your partner for your cake cutting, signing of the wedding paperwork,
            and your golden hour portraits. For most couples, those are new experiences
            so I've found it's helpful for me to coach you through it. The rest
            of the day can be fairly candid :) This is your day,
            and I want to capture it the way it happened! If there are poses you
            have in mind, feel free to text me some screenshots before your wedding day.
          </p>
          <li>Can you see a full gallery from a recent wedding?</li>
          <p>Absolutely! This is a great question to ask---wedding photographers
            share their best work in their portfolio. Seeing a full gallery lets
            you get a better idea for how many photos you'll get per hour,
            and gives you more insight into how I'll capture your entire day.

        <h3>The day-of</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>What am I like? </li>
          <p>This is one of my favorite questions! You'll be spending more time
            with me than anyone else (including your partner!) on your wedding day.
            Outside of work, I'm a bookworm (I grew up reading fantasy
            like Diane Duane's "So You Want to be a Wizard") and a Star Trek fan.
            I love to cook, especially desserts (chocolate mousse or anything
            else with whipped cream). I love to hike, birdwatch, and take landscape photos.
            I'm trying to visit all 50 states before I turn 30 (39 down, 11 to go).
            I love to connect with my couples over shared hobbies, travel plans,
            and other interests.
            <!-- One of my biggest pet peeves is dental hygenists who ask questions
            while they're cleaning my teeth! I'll be chatty between poses and
            as we walk between backgrounds, but I won't expect you to be talkative
            while I'm taking your photo!  -->
          </p>
          <li>What will I be wearing?</li>
          <p>I know that in some cultures and traditions, certain colors or cuts
            are taboo for weddings! For example, I never wear white ;) I tend to
            wear darker colors with floral prints because I don't want to stand out,
            but I also don't want to look like I'm at a funeral!
            I often wear a knee length dress, but I'm happy to wear jeans if you
            want me to fit in with a more casual wedding.
          </p>
          <li>What is my shooting style?</li>
          <p>I pose most of my golden hour portraits and family photos, but essentially
            everything else (the shots of your first dance, reception, and wedding
            ceremony, etc) will be candid!</p>
          <li>Will I bring an assistant or "second shooter"?</li>
          <p>Now that COVID is easing up, I'm hoping you'll be comfortable with
            me bringing a second again! My experienced second photographers cost
            $40/hour on top of quote I gave you, but I have a rotation of novices
            who I can bring in at no additional charge.</p>
          <!-- <li></li>
          <p></p> -->
        </ol>
        <h3>Afterwards</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Will you send a sneak-peak? </li>
          <p>I can do that! With a week of your wedding, I'll email a link to a
            Google Photos album that contains your sneak peak. If I spent eight hours
            photographing your wedding day, I'll send 15-25 photos, for a three hour wedding,
            I'll send 5-10 photos.
          </p>
          <li>How much do you edit photos? </li>
          <p>My editing style is "bright&vivid" with a hint of "light&airy".
            This lets me edit with a subtle hand so you get the "filter-less" look
            that won't look dated in five or ten years. I edit photos
            in Lightroom. I usually bring up the brightness and adjust
            the color balance. Generally, I only re-touch photos only to remove
            something from the background or a stain on someone's clothing.
            For anything much bigger, I prefer to outsource to a specialist.
          </p>
          <li>When will I get the photos?</li>
          <p>I have always been able to deliver wedding photos within one month!
            If you need them faster for any reason, let me know and we can chat
            about your timeline. If your wedding is not in August, my busiest month,
            I can often can deliver photos within two weeks. </p>
          <li>Can I share my photos online?</li>
          <p>Of course! As your contract says, you have the right to download,
            print, or otherwise share your photos! I retain the copyright, which means
            that I have the right to use the photos to advertise my business on
            sites like Facebook and Instagram.</p>
